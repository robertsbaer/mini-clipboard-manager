## üìÅ Project Files

*   `manifest.json`: The core file that defines the extension's properties, permissions, background scripts, content scripts, and popup UI.
*   `background.js`: Handles the creation of context menu items and the logic for saving items to `chrome.storage.local`. It ensures only the `MAX_ITEMS` (10) most recent items are kept.
*   `popup.html`: The HTML structure for the extension's popup window that displays saved items.
*   `popup.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the popup. It loads items from storage, renders them, and handles user interactions like copying, deleting items, and toggling instructions.
*   `popup.css`: Provides the styling for the `popup.html` interface, ensuring a clean and user-friendly look.
*   `content.js`: A content script injected into web pages. It listens for `copy` events and sends the copied text to `background.js` to be saved.
*   `icons/Clipboard.png`: The icon used for the extension, displayed in the Chrome toolbar and extensions page.
